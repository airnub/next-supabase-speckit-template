# ADR-0001 â€” Use Requirement IDs with Tagged Tests

- Status: Accepted
- Date: 2025-09-22

## Context
We want deterministic traceability from requirements to code and tests without manual bookkeeping.

## Decision
Adopt IDs like `APP-REQ-###` and tag tests with the same IDs (e.g., `@APP-REQ-001`). Require an Agent Task Envelope on PRs and use commit trailers (`Spec-ID:`).

## Consequences
- Pros: auditable, automatable RTM; easier CI gating.
- Cons: lightweight ceremony; requires team adherence.
