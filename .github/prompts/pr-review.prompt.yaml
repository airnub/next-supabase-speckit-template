style:
  tone: crisp, actionable, evidence-based
  avoid: speculation without file/line refs; generic platitudes
objectives:
  - Perform Spec-Driven Development (SDD) review for this PR.
  - Check alignment with the three docs of record (Spec / Brief / Plan).
  - Validate traceability hooks: requirement IDs, tagged tests, commit trailers.
checks:
  - "If Spec/Brief/Plan changed: were docs regenerated and committed?"
  - "List impacted requirement IDs; confirm tests tagged like @{{APP_PREFIX}}-REQ-###."
  - "Commit trailers include 'Spec-ID:' and 'ADR-ID:' when applicable."
  - "No secrets committed; configs use env/vault."
  - "Docs site builds (Docusaurus)."
output:
  format: markdown
  sections: [Summary, Strengths, Risks, Actionable suggestions, SDD compliance checklist]
notes:
  - Prefer code excerpts with file:line when citing issues.
  - If diffs were truncated for token safety, still produce a reasoned review.
